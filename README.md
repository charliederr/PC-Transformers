# PC-Transformers

## **Overview**

The PC-Transformers model combines the Transformer architecture with Predictive Coding to enable layer-wise prediction and local weight updates. Each layer predicts the next layer's activity, computes the prediction error, infers latent states, and updates weights. This approach aims to mimic biologically plausible learning mechanisms while maintaining the performance benefits of Transformers. 

The project leverages the [Penn Treebank dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aliakay8/penn-treebank-dataset/data
) for training and inference.

### 1. PC Layer
The PCLayer implements the predictive coding mechanism at each transformer layer. It functions as a local inference and learning module that infers latent activities by minimizing the prediction error between the predicted output and the target activity. Additionally, it performs local weight updates using Hebbian learning for the layer weights and applies an Anti-Hebbian learning rule to lateral connections, with all updates driven by the layerâ€™s prediction errors.

### 2. Transformer Components
The PCTransformer model consists of several key components, each integrated with the PCLayer to enable predictive coding-based inference. The Embedding Layer predicts the initial input to the transformer blocks by combining word and position embeddings. Each Transformer Block contains two main parts: an Attention mechanism, which applies predictive coding not only to the attention output but also internally to the score projection through the query, key, and value projections; and an MLP, where the first feedforward layer predicts the input to the second feedforward layer, and the second layer predicts the activity of the next transformer block. Finally, the Output Layer is a linear layer that produces token logits and also employs the PCLayer to perform local weight updates and iterative inference.
